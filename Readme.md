## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see
<https://quarto.org>.  
  
For example this is a Quarto Document you can customize how your text
appears here are some examples:

-   **This is Bold Text.**

-   *This is Italic Text*

-   <u>This is Underline Text</u>

I also included bullet points.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 1])
plt.show()
```

<img
src="Quarto_intro.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/fig-plot-1.png"
width="672" />

You can add options to executable code like this

    [1] 4

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
