## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.\
\
For example this is a Quarto Document you can customize how your text appears here are some examples:

-   **This is Bold Text.**

-   *This is Italic Text*

-   [This is Underline Text]{.underline}

I also included bullet points.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: "A Python Plot"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 1])
plt.show()
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
