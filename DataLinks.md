The raw and cleaned HMDA datasets used in this project are too large to
be hosted on GitHub, so they are provided via Google Drive:

-   [Download
    HMDA_raw.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fCgk9FL99JmlvJLb1hXdqftbLpWLqxt2/view?usp=sharing)
-   [Download
    HMDA_clean.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fYoi9wso3Bg9INfzf9LHZesexkHiCZ52/view?usp=sharing)

**To use these files:**

1\. Download both and place them in a folder named `data/` in the
project root.

2\. Run `data_preprocessing.r` to recreate or analyze the cleaned
dataset.
